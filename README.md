# Neural Network from Scratch

Neural Network built from scratch using Numpy


This project was done for educational purposes only. It may not be very efficient and possibly contains poor coding practices, but I intend to get better as I learn.

The goal of this project was to understand the and implement the mathematics behind the operation and training of Neural Networks and to be able to use it to solve a basic problem.

Note: The implementation of the Neural Network is inspired from Pytorch.


This Neural Network was used on two problems:
- Approximating a XOR gate
- Recognizing handwritten digits from images
